# Parallel_robot
Parallel manipulation can offer a number of advantages over conventional serial manipulation withrespect to optimising operational speed while retaining high accuracy in positioning.  In this study a parallel robot manipulator was developed to achieve precise end effector positioning in a three-dimensional workspace.  The mechanical assembly and the control programme were built composed from scratch and several applications were executed to test the capabilities of the robot.

This offers the programme code used for the pick and place application.
